            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Democratic-Republican Party, also known as the Jeffersonian Republicans, was founded by Thomas Jefferson 
                and James Madison in opposition to the Federalist Party. It championed republicanism, individual rights, 
                and limited federal government power.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Principles</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Strict interpretation of the Constitution</li>
                <li>States&apos; rights over federal power</li>
                <li>Support for agriculture and rural interests</li>
                <li>Opposition to a national bank</li>
                <li>Pro-French foreign policy</li>
                <li>Emphasis on individual liberties</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Notable Leaders</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Thomas Jefferson (3rd President)</li>
                <li>James Madison (4th President)</li>

                <li>John Quincy Adams (6th President)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Historical Impact</h2>
            <p>
                The Democratic-Republican Party dominated American politics during the First Party System era. 
                Its success led to the &quot;Era of Good Feelings&quot; under Monroe&apos;s presidency, when it was effectively 
                the only national political party.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Louisiana Purchase (1803)</li>
                <li>Repealing the Alien and Sedition Acts</li>
                <li>Establishing the University of Virginia</li>
                <li>Monroe Doctrine (1823)</li>
                <li>Reducing the national debt</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Decline and Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                The party began to fragment in the 1824 presidential election, eventually splitting into several factions. 
                These factions would later evolve into the modern Democratic Party and the short-lived National Republican Party.
            </p>

            <h2>Ideological Evolution</h2>
            <p>
                While initially advocating for strict constructionism and states&apos; rights, the party&apos;s positions evolved 
                during its years in power. Under Madison and Monroe, it adopted some traditionally Federalist positions, 
                including support for a stronger national defense and internal improvements.

                <p>
                    The Democratic-Republican Party emerged during a crucial period in American history, as the young 
                    republic was establishing its political traditions and institutions. Its emphasis on republican 
                    values and opposition to monarchical tendencies helped shape American democratic ideals.
