            <h2>What is the Electoral College?</h2>
            <p>
                The Electoral College is the system used in United States presidential elections where electors, 
                representing each state, cast the official votes for president. This system was established by 
                Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution and modified by the 12th and 23rd Amendments.
            </p>

            <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Each state gets electoral votes equal to its total number of Senators (2) and Representatives (varies by population)</li>
                <li>The District of Columbia gets 3 electoral votes (23rd Amendment)</li>
                <li>In most states, the candidate who wins the popular vote gets all of that state&apos;s electoral votes</li>
                <li>Maine and Nebraska use a district system, splitting their electoral votes</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>
                The Electoral College was created as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress 
                and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Founding Fathers established 
                this system to balance the interests of both large and small states.
            </p>
